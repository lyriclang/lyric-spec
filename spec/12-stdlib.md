# The standard library contract

> **Partly written.** §1 was written with milestone **M3** of the Lyric 5 plan; the rest comes with
> **M8a–M10**, spec-first: each rule lands here with its conformance case before or with its
> implementation. Source of the decisions:

## Scope

What of the standard library is language: the prelude, the core interfaces and their contracts (hash, order, clone), the answer forms and the panic rule, the naming law.

## 1. The converters the compiler binds

The functions of `std.string` an f-string hole and `+` on strings compile to, by name
([10 S-series](https://github.com/lyriclang/lyric/blob/main/design/v5/spec/10-stdlib.md)): a
program need not import them for an f-string to work, and a program that imports them gets
the same functions.

| Function | Text |
|---|---|
| `concat(a: string, b: string): string` | the two joined; what `+` on strings is |
| `fromInt(value: int): string` | the decimal digits, `-` when negative ([03 §1.7](03-types.md)) |
| `fromUint(value: uint): string` | the decimal digits |
| `fromFloat(value: float): string` | the shortest text that reads back as the value; `inf`, `-inf`, `NaN` ([03 §1.7](03-types.md)) |
| `fromBool(value: bool): string` | `true` or `false` |
| `fromChar(value: char): string` | the character, UTF-8 |

A narrower integer or a `float32` in a hole widens to the converter's parameter type first
([03 §1.3](03-types.md)): `f"{x}"` with `x: int8` is `fromInt(x)`, with `x: float32` it is
`fromFloat(x)`.

## Numbers

The ten number types conform, in `std.core`, to a tower of interfaces (design 10 B5 Z1), whose
parent lists fix the operators' `Out` to `Self` ([05 §8](05-interfaces.md) rule 7), so
arithmetic stays in the type:

| Interface | Parents | Members | Conformers |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Num` | `Equatable`, `Ordered`, `Add`, `Sub`, `Mul`, `Div`, `Rem` (each `<Out = Self>`), `Display`, `Debug`, `Default` | `static let zero, one: Self`; `isZero(): bool` | all ten |
| `Signed` | `Num`, `Neg<Out = Self>` | `abs(): Self`, `signum(): Self` | `int8`…`int`, `float32`, `float` |
| `Integer` | `Num`, `TotalOrder`, `Hashable`, the bit operators (each `<Out = Self>`) | `static let min, max: Self`; `static let bitWidth: int`, `isSigned: bool` | `int8`…`int`, `uint8`…`uint` |

`isZero`, `abs` and `signum` are defaults, each type's own ([05 §1](05-interfaces.md) rule 4):
`signum` gives `-1`, `0` or `1` in the type, and a float's NaN stays NaN. `uint` has no `abs`.

`Integer` says where its arithmetic would leave the type, each a default:

- `checkedAdd`, `checkedSub`, `checkedMul`, `checkedDiv`, `checkedRem` (`o: Self`) give `?Self`:
  `null` where the result does not fit, or the divisor is zero; `min / -1` does not fit, and a
  remainder by `-1` is `0`.
- `saturatingAdd`, `saturatingSub`, `saturatingMul` hold at `min` or `max`, by the sign the
  result would have.
- `wrappingAdd`, `wrappingSub`, `wrappingMul` reduce modulo 2^`bitWidth`, as `+%`, `-%`, `*%` do a
  builtin's ([08](08-expressions.md)); `wrappingDiv` gives `min` for `min / -1` and
  `wrappingRem` `0` for a remainder by `-1` — a zero divisor panics as `/` does.
- `pow(n: uint): Self` multiplies by squaring; an overflow is one of `*`
  ([03](03-types.md)).
- `leadingZeros`, `trailingZeros` and `popCount` count bits at the type's width (`bitWidth` for
  zero); `rotateLeft(n)` and `rotateRight(n)` rotate modulo the width, a negative `n` the other
  way.
